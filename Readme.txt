The free and easiest way to double your email subscribers. Also includes Sharing tools to double your traffic from Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. 

== Description ==

Most blogs are designed for hit-and-run readers. People find your blog, read your article, and leave. Wouldn't it be nice if some of those people subscribe or share your amazing post?

SumoMe provides the tools you need to grow your blog by engaging your readers. The features of this plugin will make it easy for your readers share your articles and engage in your community. Highlighter makes it easy to tweet about your article by selecting popular parts of your writing (like Kindle and Medium); ImageSharer makes it stupid simple to share your images (with a link to your post) on Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter; while the List Builder tool in this plugin will let you create a fancy lightbox popover to [build email subscriptions](http://sumome.com/) (for MailChimp, GetResponse, Aweber, or others).

Now, people will find your blog, read your article, share your article on Twitter/Facebook/Pinterest, and subscribe via email to your MailChimp email newsletter.

= List Builder (email subscribe feature) =

The most important asset on your blog isn't your theme or even your content. It's your email list. As you build your email subscriber list, promoting your new posts becomes faster and more effective as you can quickly send a notification to thousands of interested people who want to ready your content.

While most email subscription boxes are static widgets in your sidebar, our MailChimp/Aweber list builder generates extra attention and higher signup rates by launching an unobtrusive popover signup box. You can decide whether this box loads manually after the visitor has been on your page for a few seconds or automatically when the mouse moves away from the page (much like Exit Monitor).

= Choose when to request subscribes =

You can adjust the List Builder settings to automatically load the popover subscription form after a set period of time - like 10 seconds - so it loads after your visitor has started reading. Alternately, you can set a much shorter load time - like 1 second - so that more of your visitors see the MailChimp subscribe box before leaving.

= Optional smart load timing =

The optional smart timing will automatically load the Aweber email subscription box when we think the reader is getting ready to leave. Much like Exit Monitor, we do this by monitoring mouse movements that determine exit intent. When the mouse moves toward the X to close your website, the popover will quickly ask for their email. (Note: This isn't a popup, so it won't interfere with closing the tab.)


= Connect with major email providers =

Our email list builder easily connects with all major email providers including Aweber, MailChimp, Constant Contact, GetResponse and Campaign Monitor. This means that if you use an email manager like MailChimp, your new subscribers can automatically subscribe to your list instantly.

Alternately, you can simply set List Builder to collect email addresses that you can export in CSV format.

= Easily modify design =

The email form is completely customizable. You can quickly change the wording, confirmation message, and colors to match the rest of your website. This will increase conversions by making users more comfortable subscribing.

= Or go completely old school =

If you really want to customize your email popover, you can actually edit the full HTML. You can add a different form, select specific pages to not show the popover on, and even add a redirected confirmation URL. Customize to your heart's content.

= Highlighter (Twitter sharing feature) =

Designed to encourage sharing on Twitter, the Highlighter feature lets readers easily select portions of your article to share as quotes on Twitter. Popularly tweeted sections are highlighted on your blog which boosts Twitter sharing significantly. It's an automatic click-to-tweet.

= Get more tweets =

The Highlighter feature improves Twitter shares in two important ways. First, we let users highlight portions of your text to quickly quote on Twitter. Similar to Kindle's sharing feature or Medium's commenting design, this functionality makes tweeting about your latest post quick and easy. Social sharing has never been easier.

= Highlight popular sentences =

When someone tweets a quote from your article, our plugin automatically highlights that portion of your text. Much like the popular highlights feature in Kindle, this attracts your reader's attention and boosts social sharing. These highlights can also be edited by the admin if you don't want a particular highlight showing.

= Include your username in tweets =

Tweets generated through Highlighter will both link to your article and include your Twitter username. This will build traffic to your website while also boosting your Twitter profile and building your Twitter following. Adding your Twitter username is as easy as typing your username into the Highlighter settings - you don't need to give access to your Twitter account.

= ImageSharer (Image sharing feature) =

Have you ever noticed how some blogs and websites make it easy to share their images on social networks like Pinterest?  Because these images link back to your article, people who share your images on Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook can drive significant traffic to your website.  ImageSharer makes it easy for you to add professional image sharing to your website with just a click of the button.

= Image sharing for Pinterest =

Pinterest is one of the fastest growing social networks right now, and some studies have found Pinterest users spend more than other social network visitors.  By making it easy for your visitors to share their favorite images from your blog on Pinterest, we're helping you unlock a major source of valuable traffic that many bloggers aren't even pursuing yet.

= Image sharing for Facebook =

Did you know that photo posts on Facebook get 84% more click-throughs than text posts (according to KISSmetrics)?  The ImageSharer plugin makes it stupid simple for your readers to easily share your beautiful images on Facebook with just a click of the button.

= Image sharing for Twitter =

According to Buffer, image tweets on Twitter get fully 2x the engagement of text tweets!  Essentially, every time one of your readers shares an image from your blog, you're getting the equivalent of two ordinary tweets.

= Easy image sharing for all three social networks =

ImageSharer makes it super easy to add image sharing for all three powerful social networks without any coding or frustrating setup.  Simply install the SumoMe plugin, click to activate ImageSharer, and watch your share stats start rolling in.
